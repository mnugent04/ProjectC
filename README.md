## Region
* I chose California because I was born and raised there, and I hope to continue living there as an adult. Since the financial landscape of California will greatly affect my future, understanding its economy is both relevant and important to me. Additionally, I am curious to learn more about the factors that influence the cost of living in California.

 ## Datasets
I have selected four different datasets for this project:
  1. Median Household Income in California
     * Knowing the median income of Californians helps to assess the affordability of various everyday needs.

  2. Zillow Home Value Index
     * Housing is an essential part of life, and understanding its affordability is a key aspect of this data visualization and storytelling.

  4. California All Grades All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices
     * Gas is a necessity and often a significant expense. I wanted to explore how much it impacts monthly finances.

  5. State Minimum Wage Rate for California
     * I was interested in analyzing how livable minimum wage is in California.
